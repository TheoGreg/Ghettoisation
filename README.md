# Social Simulation

Quick Python project to observe how different groups living in the same area can create neighbourhoods depending on their acceptance rate of other groups. 

## Concept
Epoch after epoch individual from each group will randomly move and accept their new location depending on the composition of their closest neighbours. If refused, the individual will keep randomly searching for place to settle.
More details in the code !

## Results
A few trials were made for various acceptance rates with various initial situations in order to find the switching regime.
